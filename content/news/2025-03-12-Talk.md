Our club recently hosted an exciting talk titled "Deep into the Fundamental: How Maths Makes ML Magical" by Pat Vatiwutipong (P'Gui), the creator of the Facebook page [คณิตศาสตร์อย่างที่ควรจะเป็น](https://www.facebook.com/mathasitis). The session took place on March 23, 2025, at the Faculty of ICT, Mahidol University. We kicked off the event with a brief introduction to machine learning, followed by an engaging experience-sharing session.
